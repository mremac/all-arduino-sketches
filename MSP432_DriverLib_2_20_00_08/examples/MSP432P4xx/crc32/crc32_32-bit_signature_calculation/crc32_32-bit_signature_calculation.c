 * MSP432 CRC32 - CRC32 Calculation
 *
 * Description: In this example, the CRC32 module is used to calculate a CRC32
 * checksum in CRC32 bit mode. This is a very simple example that just pipes
 * in the contents of an arbitrary array to the CRC32 module and the result
 * is placed into a local variable. The debugger is used by the user to observe
 * the result.
