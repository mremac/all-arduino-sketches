 * MSP432 PCM - Complete Shutdown
 *
 * Description: In this example, the PCM's ability to completely shutdown the
 * device is demonstrated with the PCM DriverLib APIs. The device is setup
 * to interrupt when the switch connected to P1.1 is pressed. When woken up,
 * the device will go into complete shutdown using the appropriate PCM API.
